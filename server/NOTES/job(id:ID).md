The job(id: ID!):
 Job field is declared inside the Query type because it represents 
 a specific query operation that can be performed in your GraphQL API. 
 
Let me explain why this is the case:

1.Root Types in GraphQL:
   GraphQL schemas have root types, and Query is one of them (along with Mutation and Subscription).
   The Query type is special because it defines the entry points for read operations in your API.

2.Entry Points for Queries:
  Fields defined inside the Query type become available as "top-level" query operations. 
  This means clients can directly request these fields when they want to fetch data.

3.Operational vs. Object Types:
  While Job and Company are object types that "describe the structure" of your data, 
  the fields in Query describe operations that can be performed to retrieve that data.

4.Hierarchical Data Access:
  By placing job(id: ID!): Job inside Query, you're saying "this is a way to directly fetch a job by its ID". 
  If it were defined separately, there would be no clear way for clients to use this query.

5.API Design:
  This structure helps in organizing your API. 
  All read operations are grouped under Query, making it clear what queries are available at the root level of your API.
