In React, a component lifecycle refers to the "series of events" that 
a component goes through to from it's creation to it's destruction

I.)Mounting
   --the initial phase when the component is CREATED and ADDED to the DOM
   --the component is born, it learns its sorroundings(DOM) and then
     it starts to exist on the screen.

II.)Updating
    --this phase occurs when the component's props or state change

III.)Unmounting
     --This phase occurs when the component is REMOVED from the DOM.
